## Notice
We do not own most of the Flappy Bird assets, or the Flappy Bird name, some of the assets
were extracted straight from the game. They are the work and copyright of original 
creator Dong Nguyen and .GEARS games (http://www.dotgears.com/).

I took this Tweet (https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/431060041009856512 /

invitation to reuse the game concept and assets in an open source project. 
There is no intention to steal the game, or claim the Flappy Bird name as my own.

If the copyright holder would like for the assets to be removed, please open an 
issue to start the conversation.
